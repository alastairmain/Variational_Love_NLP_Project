NLP project for DTU Course 02456 Deep Learning

The following code presents different Deep Learning approaches to collaborative filtering. These include Matrix Factorization (MF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Bag of Words (BoW), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and finally, LSTM using Attention. 

The models were coded on the Movielens and CiteULike datasets.

MF and FFNN models have been tested on Movielens datasets

BOW, LSTM and LSTM w. Attention have been tested on CiteULike datasets with text classification.
